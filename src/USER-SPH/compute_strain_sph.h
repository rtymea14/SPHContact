/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running LAMMPS to see the offending line.

E: Could not find compute strain/sph temperature ID

Self-explanatory.

E: Compute strain/sph temperature ID does not compute temperature

The specified compute must compute temperature.

E: Per-atom virial was not tallied on needed timestep

You are using a thermo keyword that requires potentials to have
tallied the virial, but they didn't on this timestep.  See the
variable doc page for ideas on how to make this work.
